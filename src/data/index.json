      "current-diet-action-description": "You've said that you're not vegan - yet! Although B12 is only available from animal foods, such as meat, fish and dairy, many vegetarians and meat-eaters are still deficient in B12. This is because your digestive function must be optimal to absorb enough B12, plus you have to consume a few portions of B12-containing foods per day. It has been suggested that 7 ug/day is the optimal dose of B12 for those with no digestive issues. If you have any digestive or gut issues, you may need a lot more - and that's pretty difficult to get from food. To give you an idea: * 1 cup (250 ml) of milk provides between 2-3 ug *a cup of yogurt provides 1-1.5 ug *a 30g portion of most cheeses provides less than 1 ug *eggs contain around 0.5 ug B12 per large egg, but it is not easily absorbed.   So, even while you’re not yet vegan, you might still benefit from supplementing with B12 if you're not eating enough of the above foods every day to make up your B12 intake.",
